✅ Emotion Tracking via Emotion Wheels
Emotion wheels assist users in identifying and labeling their emotions, from core feelings to nuanced secondary and tertiary emotions. This structured approach enhances emotional awareness and self-regulation. Research shows that individuals with higher emotional granularity—meaning they can distinguish between different negative emotions—are significantly less likely to react aggressively or impulsively (Kashdan, Barrett, & McKnight, 2015). Emotional differentiation also plays a critical role in reducing maladaptive emotional responses and improving emotion regulation (Barrett, Gross, Christensen, & Benvenuto, 2001).
Structured Thought Records (Challenging Cognitive Distortions)
Thought records help users identify negative automatic thoughts, evaluate their accuracy, and reframe them into more adaptive perspectives. This tool aligns with core CBT practices. Evidence shows that completing CBT homework assignments—especially thought records—predicts better outcomes in depression and anxiety (Rees, McEvoy, & Nathan, 2005). As Kazantzis et al. (2010) note, “both the quantity and quality of homework completed predicted outcome on measures of 
✅ Journaling with AI Analysis for Patterns
Digital journaling with AI analysis offers users insight into their emotional patterns by analyzing entries using natural language processing (NLP). A study by Calvo, Milne, Hussain, and Christensen (2017) supports the use of NLP in mental health tools, noting its capacity to extract emotional and cognitive signals from text. This enables AI-based tools to assist in identifying stressors and recurring thought patterns, which in turn promotes self-awareness and supports therapeutic goals (Inkster et al., 2018).
✅ SMART Goal Setting for Therapeutic Progress
SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) provide structure and motivation by giving users concrete steps toward personal improvement. Schunk (2012) found that goal specificity significantly enhances performance and engagement. Similarly, setting clearly defined goals improves therapeutic outcomes and fosters self-efficacy (Locke & Latham, 2002). In educational and clinical contexts, clients who define specific goals are more likely to maintain commitment and experience measurable progress (Morisano, Hirsh, Peterson, Pihl, & Shore, 2010).
✅ Tracking Coping Strategies and Protective Factors
Tracking coping strategies and protective factors allows users to reflect on what supports their resilience and well-being. Compas et al. (2001) found substantial links between coping styles and psychological adjustment, especially in youth. Werner (1995) emphasized that protective factors—such as strong relationships or adaptive habits—play a major role in resilience. Monitoring these elements digitally allows for personalized insights that support long-term mental health stability (Zimmer-Gembeck & Skinner, 2011).
